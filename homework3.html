                Let's consider this dataset showing a bivariate distribution: <br>
                <img src="media/image/distributions2.png" alt="Dataset with a bivariate distribution" style="max-width: 100%;">
                <br>
                We define <b>joint relative frequencies</b> as how many times a combination of two conditions happens together. <br>
                It is calculated by doing Joint Frequency / Total Frequency. <br>
                So every single grey value is a joint frequency.
                 <br> For example: <br>
                P(Male ∩ Basket) = 13/100 = 0.13 = 13% <br>
                P(Female ∩ Basketball) = 16/100 = 0.16 = 16% <br>
                <br>
                We define <b>marginal relative frequency</b> as the ratio between the frequency of a row total or column total to the total frequency of the statistical units. <br>
                It is calculated by doing Row (or Column) / Total Frequency. <br>
                In our example the yellow values (except the 100) are marginal frequencies. <br>
                For example: <br>
                P(Male) = 48/100 = 0.48 = 48% <br>
                P(Football) = 33/100 = 0.33 = 33% <br>
                <br>
                We define <b>conditional relative frequency</b> as a fraction that tells you how many members of a group have a particular characteristic. <br>
                More technically, it is the ratio of a frequency in the center of the table (joint relative frequency) to the frequency’s row total or column total (marginal relative frequency). <br>
                For example: <br>
                Knowing that they are males how many of them like football? <br> 
                P(Football | Male) = P(Football ∩ Male) / P(Male) = 20/48 = 0.416 = 41.6% <br>
                Knowing that they like basketball, how many of them are females? <br>
                P(Female | Basketball) = P(Female ∩ Basketball) / P(Basketball) = 16/31 = 0.516 = 51.6% <br>
