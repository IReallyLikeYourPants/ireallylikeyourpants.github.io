            Online we can find various definitions of Statistics. The two most common one are:
            <br>- It is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.
            <br>- It is a science (systematic body of knowledge) which collects and uses data.
            <br>Some sites refer to Statistics as a branch of Math that collects, analyzes and interprets data, but this definition is not correct as 
            Statistics is not the same things as Math, not even a branch, because they only share the theory of probability.
            <br>We can visualize Statistics as a science that touch differents disciplines like Chemistry, Physics, Sociology, Biology and interacts with them.
            <br>
            To perform a statistical search, it’s conventional to begin with a population of interest the so colled "statistical population" 
            ("statistical model") that it’s made by the statistical units (all objects that we want to analyze).
            <br>
            Statistics can be used for example to create a model to predict certain reality behaviour and it's used in different fields such as economy, medicine, sociology, science.

            The term dataset refers to any organized collection of data: it lists values for each of the variables and for each member of the dataset. 
            Data consist of information coming from observations or measurement. Data represent something, like body weight, the age of a child, 
            the temperature outside, etc. Qualitative data consist of labels, non- numeric entries. Quantitative data consist of numerical measurements of 
            counts and numbers used for calculations. The 'thing' that the data represents is called a variable, any entity that can take on more than one value. 
            Simply put, variable vary. For instance, the variable “age” can take different values for different people or for the same people at different time. 
            Variables are the building blocks of statistics. Some variables have values that are attributes or characteristics of an object. The variable agreement 
            might be defined as having five attributes: 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree. 
            The variable is only the operationalized way in which the attribute(s) is or are represented for further data processing, i.e. in a table or database.
