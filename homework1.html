            Online we can find various definitions of Statistics. The two most common one are:
            <br>- It is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.
            <br>- It is a science (systematic body of knowledge) which collects and uses data.
            <br>Some sites refer to Statistics as a branch of Math that collects, analyzes and interprets data, but this definition is not correct as 
            Statistics is not the same things as Math, not even a branch, because they only share the theory of probability.
            <br>We can visualize Statistics as a science that touch differents disciplines like Chemistry, Physics, Sociology, Biology and interacts with them.
            <br>
            To perform a statistical search, it’s conventional to begin with a population of interest the so colled "statistical population" 
            ("statistical model") that it’s made by the statistical units (all objects that we want to analyze).
            <br>
            Statistics can be used for example to create a model to predict certain reality behaviour and it's used in different fields such as economy, medicine, sociology, science.

            Dataset refers to any organized collection of data, typically it is represented in a table way. 
            It lists variables for each of the attributes (column) and for each member of the dataset (row) so called record/unit.
            <br>A unit is one member of a set of entities being studied and it has one (univariate statistics) or more attributes (multivariate statistics).
            All the units are called set of statistical units.
            <br>Attributes are specific qualities, characteristics or features that can be shared by multiple subjects like body weight, 
            hair colour, the temperature outside.
            <br>Variables are the building block of statistic and they consist of information coming from observations or measurement like values from body weight, 
            hair colour, the temperature outside, etc and they can be created, analyzed, manipulated and processed by computer programs.
            <br>It is also necessary to decide the scale of measurements or the precision of the measure of each attribute.
            There are generally two measures: quantitative measure (meters, centimeters) and qualitative one (tall, short or medium).
            <br>Datasets are stored tyipically in an excel file or in a DBMS.
            <br>Datasets and Statistics can be used for example to create a model to predict certain reality behaviour, to better understand reality and 
            minimize risks resulting from randomness.
