                Arithmetic mean is a single value that it is used to summarize an entire set. When we calculate the average we lose 
                some precision but we gain synthesis. <br>
                The formula to obtain the arithmetic mean of a set of  values is well known and is the following: <br>
                <img src="media/image/mean2.png"  style="height: auto; width: 280px;">
                <br>
                We can derivate this formula from different definitions of mean, that we saw in class: <br>
                - A value that substituted for all elements of the set returns the same value, so we have: <br>
                <br>
                <img src="media/image/mean3.png"  style="height: auto; width: 100px;">
                <br>
                <img src="media/image/mean4.png"  style="height: auto; width: 120px;">
                <br>
                - A value that equates all the positive and negative differences between the mean and the values of the set. <br>
                The distance is calculated from a value called "c" (that is the mean itself if the sum of all the values is 0). <br>
                The formulas are: <br>
                <br>
                <img src="media/image/mean5.png"  style="height: auto; width: 120px;">
                <br>
                Where the second x is c. So we have: <br>
                <br>
                <img src="media/image/mean6.png"  style="height: auto; width: 280px;">
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="media/image/mean7.png"  style="height: auto; width: 100px;">
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="media/image/mean8.png"  style="height: auto; width: 120px;">
                <br>
                - A value that has the minimal distance between itself and the values of the set. The formula is: <br>
                <br>
                <img src="media/image/mean9.png"  style="height: auto; width: 120px;">
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="media/image/mean10.png"  style="height: auto; width: 60px;"> is the value between a value of the set and the mean (c if equal 0). <br>
                It is also possible to prove that this formula is equivalent to the previous ones. <br> <br>
                In a set we can also calculate other statistics like: <br>
                - <b>Geometric mean</b>, instead of the value that give the same sum we want the value that gives the same product, <br>indicates a central tendency of a set of numbers by using the product of their values. Formula: <br>
                <br>
                <img src="media/image/mean11.png"  style="height: auto; width: 250px;">
                <br>
                - <b>Harmonic mean</b>, the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the given set of observation. Formula: <br>
                <br>
                <img src="media/image/mean12.svg"  style="height: auto; width: 300px;">
                <br>
                - <b>Power mean</b> that generalize arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean. Formula: <br>
                <br>
                <img src="media/image/mean13.svg"  style="height: auto; width: 250px;">
                <br>
                if p == 1 we have the arithmetic mean, ip p == 0 the geometric mean and if p == -1 the power one. <br>
                <br>
            <p>T11. <br>
                <b>Convergence</b> in mathematics, is the property of approaching a limit more and more closely as a variable 
                of the function increases or decreases or as the number of terms of the series increases. <br>
                For example, the function y = 1/x converges to zero as x increases. 
                Although no finite value of x will cause the value of y to actually become zero, <br> 
                the limiting value of y is zero because y can be made as small as desired by choosing x large enough. 
                The line y = 0 (the x-axis) is called an asymptote of the function. <br>
                Given a continuos function f, we say that f(x) converges to the finite limit l for x 
                tends to x0 if for all ε > 0 exist  δ(ε) > 0 such that for all x 
                satisfying 0 &#60 | x - x0 | &#60 δ(ε) > 0  we have that | f(x)-l | &#60 ε. Thus:
                <br>
                <img src="media/image/mean14.svg"  style="height: auto; width: 120px;">
                <br>
                The basic idea behind the convergence probability, is that the probability of an “unusual” outcome becomes 
                smaller and smaller as the sequence progresses. <br>
                A sequence {Xn} of random variables converges in probability towards the random variable X if for all ε > 0: <br>
                <br>

                 <br>
            <p>T12. <br>
                Statistics can be divided in two sections: <br>
                - <b>Descriptive statistics</b> that defines methods and processes to describe or summarize known data. <br>
                There is a known population (statistical units) thanks to which we gain information that we want to analyse. <br>
                The data gained is then stored in a dataset, and with these data we can perform different analysis like calculate <br>
                the univariate, multivariate distribution and also the different means. <br>
                - <b>Inferential statistics</b> on the other hand doesn't have a know population, but only a sample. <br>
                So we can through the sample gain with less precision the tendencies of the whole population. <br>
                Since the majority of the population is unknown and can’t be measured, <br>
                we have to calculate the probability of a certain event or of a certain attribute 
                value on the entire population through the frequency in the sample set. <br>
                An example of this is the trials for a new medicine, usually they are tested by a sample of the population. <br>
                In descriptive statistics, all the distributions 
                are frequency distributions from known units. <br> In 
                inferential statistics we can’t determine this (because the population is unknown),  <br>
                so we have to assign to the unknown population some probability distributions, 
                that we can’t really observe and that are calculated from the sample set (they can generate some precision errors).

                I used the same application as in the previous homework. I implemented the vertical histograms. <br><br>

                The application is the one developed in class. With the left mouse button it is possible to change the position of the rectangle, with the right <br>
                mouse button change the size of the rectangle and with the mouse wheel zoom in and out. <br><br>
