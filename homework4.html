                We can show that the relative frequencies have all the properties of probability. <br>
                The properties of relative frequency are (in our example A and B are two events): <br>
                1) The relative frequency of each outcome is a number between 0 and 1 [0 &lt f(A) &lt= 1] <br>
                2) The relative frequencies of all the outcomes add up to 1 [f(A) + f(B) + … + f(Z) = 1]<br>
                3) For every pair of events that are disjoint, the probability of the union of the two events is the sum of their own probabilities [(A ∩ B) != 0 => f(A U B) = f(A) + f(B)) property of additivity]<br>
                We can see that they are practically identical to the axioms for probability: <br>
                1) For any event A, P(A) >= 0. <br>
                2) Probability of the sample space S is P(S) = 1 <br>
                3) If A, B, C, ... are disjoint events, then P(A U B U C U ...) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C)+ ... <br>
                On one hand we can define probability as the degree of expectation for a certain event to happen. <br>
                On the other hand probability is just a number associated to a set with certain properties. <br>
                Kolmogorov defined it in  1933 by axioms, he noticed also that we could use the same properties of the measure. <br>
                The main difference is that the measure doesn’t have the property of being at most equal to 1.

                We know that Measure Space is a triple (Ω,Ɛ,P) where: <br>
                . Ω is a set (sample space)<br>
                . Ɛ is a σ-algebra on the set Ω (event space) <br>
                . P is a measure on (Ω, Ɛ) (value between 0 and 1) <br>
                So Measure Space has a measurable space (Ω, Ɛ) and a measure on it P. <br>
                Let analyse the simpliest case, a single coin flip, we have: <br>
                . Ω = {0, 1} has the set <br>
                . The σ-algebra of Ɛ is the power set {Ø, {H}, {T}, Ω} <br>
                . The measure P is P({H}) = P({T}) = 1/2 and P(Ω) = 1 and P(Ø) = 0 <br>
                Another case could be the roll of the dice, in this case we have: <br>
                . Ω = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} has the set <br>
                . The σ-algebra of Ɛ is the power set {Ø, {1}, {2}, Ω, {1,2}, ...} contains all the possible events <br>
                . For example the measure of P for one roll is Pr(1) = Pr(2) = Pr(3) = Pr(4) = Pr(5) = Pr(6) = 1/6 
                 <br>

                Measure theory is the study of measures. It generalizes the notions of length, area, and volume and other
                notions such as mass and probability of events. <br>
                Measures are foundational in probability  
                theory because it unifies the discrete and the continuous cases, and makes the difference a question of which measure is used. <br>
                The reason why Measure Theory constitutes the mathematical foundation of Probability Theory is that you can define a
                σ−algebra for any probability space by having: <br>
                . The measure space, X = Ω (the outcome space) <br>
                . A set of countable collections Ɛ {Ei} (events) <br>
                . A measure μ defined on this set (which is our probability function P) <br>
                To complete the construction we only have to fix μ(Σ) = 1 to get all of the axioms of Probability Theory 
                (additivity is also defined in σ-algebras) while being able to use all results of Measure Theory.

                Thanks to the application, it is possible to generate absolute, relative and normal frequency.  <br>
                You can also choose the probability, number of steps and number of trajectories. <br>
                The application shows the graph and the histograms. <br><br>

                In order to draw graphs on VB.NET we  need 3 objects: <br>
                - A PictureBox object to display an image in a window <br>
                - A Grapichs object that provides methods for drawing objects to the display device <br>
                - A Bitmap object, used to work with images defined by pixel data, that will be the image in which we will draw <br>
                After, we have to add the bitmap to the picture box via the function FromImage. Following these steps we can draw everything we want. For example there are <br>
                functions like DrawLines and DrawRectangle. Example of the code: <br>
                <code style=" display: block; margin: 1em 1px;">
                Public b As Bitmap <br>
                Public g As Graphics <br>
                Me.b = New Bitmap(Me.PictureBox1.Width, Me.PictureBox1.Height) <br>
                Me.g = Graphics.FromImage(b) <br>
                g.DrawLines(Pens.Black, x1, y1, x2, y2) <br>
                g.DrawRectangle(Pens.Red, x, y, width, height) <br>
                </code>

            <p>TA6. <br>
                When we draw on Bitmaps, we have to be careful about the difference between the "real world" and the "virtual world". <br>
                The differences are: <br>
                - In the real world we use the Cartesian plane, so the points are real values. The origin of the plane is 0,0 and it is down on the left <br>
                - In the virtual world the image is composed by pixels, composed by a couple of integers. The origin is located up on the left <br>
                In order to get the values right, we have to make some changes through equation. These are the formulas: <br>
                X(v) = (X(r) - X(min)) / (X(max) - X(min)) * W <br>
                Y(v) = H - ((Y(r) - Y(min)) / (Y(max) - Y(min)) * H)<br>
                X(v) is the virtual x, X(r) the real one, X(max) the maximum value of X(r), X(min) the maximum value of X(r), W the width and H the height of the image. <br>
