                To talk about <b>distribution</b> we need a dataset, containing the statistical units, the attributes, and their relative values. <br>
                We define as "<b>relative frequency</b>" the number of units that have a value of a selected attribute, over the total number of units.<br> 
                We made an example in class regarding eye colour of the students. We analyzed how many students have blue eyes. <br>
                For example if we have 10 students and 2 of them have blue eyes, we can say that the relative frequency of blue eyes is 2/10. <br>
                So we can define "<b>distribution</b>" as the set of relative frequencies regarding a choosen attribute (in our case eye colour). <br>
                In our example the distribution of eye colour can for example be 2/10 blue, 6/10 brown and 2/10 green, the sum of all the values should always be 1. <br>
                The distribution is done in a different table and the data come from the initial dataset. <br>
                If we analyse only one attribute we define the distribution "<b>univariate</b>" (in our case the eye colour). <br>
                Otherwise if we analyse more than one attribute the distribution is called "<b>multivariate</b>" and it is done through the "<b>join frequency</b>" 
                (if two it is called "<b>bivariate</b>" (for example eye colour and height)). <br>
                We define "<b>marginal distribution</b>" as the distribution of the individual variables.
                In a two-way table, the marginal distributions are shown in the margins of the table. <br>
                If we consider only one column or one row from a multivariate distribution we retrieve a univariate distribution, the so called
                marginal distribution. <br>
                In fact we override the influence of the other distributions (it is used to focus on a specific attribute). <br>
                On the other hand we call "<b>conditional distribution</b>" the distribution of one attribute in relation to another one. <br>
